            <h3>Dumbell</h3>
            <p class="content_para">
              Dumbbells can provide the two types of overload that lead to muscle growth: mechanic and metabolic. Mechanic overload is the result of damaged caused by muscle contractions, which stimulates the repair process and leads to an increase in muscle size.

            <h3>Barbell</h3>
            <p class="content_para">
              The Big Four barbell exercises (squat, bench press, overhead press, and deadlift) offer an overall workout because they each utilize multiple muscle groups. Instead of switching from machine to machine to machine, you'll be able to get a total body workout by doing straightforward basic lifts.

            <h3>Treadmill</h3>
            <p class="content_para">
              If getting in shape and/or losing weight are primary concerns, treadmills might be the best machine to accomplish these objectives. In a recent study comparing exercise, users who felt that they had exercised equally strenuously on bikes and treadmills actually spent 25% more calories on the treadmill.
