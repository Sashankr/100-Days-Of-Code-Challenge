        <h2>A timeline of Hans Zimmer's journey in Music Production</h2>
        <p>
          Hans Zimmer has composed music for over 150 films in an illustrious career spanning more than 30 years, winning two Golden Globes, four Grammys and the 1994 Oscar for "The Lion King." 
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span>Rain Man(1988)</span> <p>
              Marks a turning point in Zimmer's career. He composed this remarkable score, which accompanies a successful film at the box office and made his first Oscar nomination. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>The Lion King(1988)</span> 
            <p>
              He rose with his first and only Oscar. Hans composed a mature soundtrack that lived up to the great classic of Disney, as he knew how to convey the essence of Africa. He made the children and parents weep with emotion and see themselves identified with the Disney-shaped story.

          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Gladiator(2000)</span> 
            <p>
              Zimmer does not start the score in a powerful and heroic way, on the contrary, the melody is dropped gently transporting us many centuries ago to a hostile antiquity, which to a certain point isn't disturbing. Severe strings warn us of the dark history. The melancholy is noted by extolling the memory of the home with a sad female voice. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <span>Batman Begins(2005)</span>
              <p>
                In 2005, director Christopher Nolan did a miracle that nobody thought would happen: resurrect the franchise of Batman.
              <br>
              Zimmer and Newton Howard decided not to copy what was made, so this soundtrack is not exempt from Zimmer's modern and traditional fusion. This one composed the subjects of action, whereas Newton Howard worked the dramatic pieces. Both achieved another fusion with their styles, and with it, they managed to capture the essence of the dark plot and the characterization of the characters.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Inception (2010)</span> 
            <p>
              This is his third collaboration for Nolan after "Batman Begins" and "The Dark Knight". Hans Zimmer has excelled mix electronic sounds with traditional orchestral arrangements, thus achieving a dynamic fusion and even tension, as well as the rhythm.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Interstellar (2014)</span>
            <p>
              The music that surrounds the film is beautiful and inspiring, making the viewer feel the emotions that Nolan wanted to convey with the film. His score is worthy of any great composer.
